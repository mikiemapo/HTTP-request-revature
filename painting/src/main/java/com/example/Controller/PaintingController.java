     * REST
     * Representational State Transfer
     * - we are transfering data that is a representation of some 'entity' in our application - is a resource (cars, movies, paintings, users, etc)
     * - we follow a certain set of guidelines to properly leverage HTTP requests/responses
     *      - self-descriptive URI's
     *      - URI is a pattern that identifies a particular resource
     *      - a restful URI contains only nouns, not verbs
     *      - we define what action we'd like to perform on the resource using the HTTP verb
     *      - we properly inform the sender of the request of the status of the request using the right response
     * - statelessness
     *      - because we don't store any data in-memory past the lifetime of the request/response, a RESTful api is infinitely scaleable
     *          - we can still use a database! it's external to our api. our api's job is just to manage requests/responses.
     *          - let's say that every request added items to our arraylist. (eg we're keeping track of security tokens for every active user.)
     *          - this is fine for a small amount of users.. scale up to several million, your api is now pretty slow, probably, so we don't do this
     * 
     * REST is neither the only common practice for api design (SOAP... good luck), nor is it mandatory - oftentimes, you just need to break
     * convention, do the wrong thing, and, if you'd like to sound like you know what you're doing, call it an "anti-pattern"
